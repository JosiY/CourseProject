Course Project Getting and Cleaning Data
----------------------------------------

The assumed data structure is:
	"wearable_data" 
in the current working directory
and in parallel to the 
        "run_analysis.R".

To run this script place the data contained in the zip file under 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

as mentioned above and run the content of "run_analysis.R".
The data read from the dataset will be cleaned and summarized 
and the result is written to 

	"tidyData_run_analysis.txt"
